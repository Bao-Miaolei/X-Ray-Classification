Thorax Disease Prediction via Machine Learning-based X-ray Classification

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/sample) utilized in this study originates from a publicly available random sample of the National Institute's collection of chest X-ray images in the United States. The original collection comprised 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. Our sample consists of 5,606 images, each with dimensions of 1024 x 1024 pixels, accompanied by a dataset containing image information, disease type labels, and patient demographics (ID, age, gender, number of follow-ups). In this study, we employed two supervised machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to predict the presence of thoracic diseases. We assessed and compared the prediction accuracy of these models to evaluate their performance and suitability. Additionally, we investigated the potential benefits of incorporating demographic information into the models.
